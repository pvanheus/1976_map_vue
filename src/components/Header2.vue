        I have to emphasise that this information on this map is incomplete and likely to be
        (in some details at least) inaccurate. It is a start, not an end, of an attempt to keep
        this part of our past in our memory. In particular, the street location of each murder is
        inexact, as I was working off place names, not street names.

        The events behind the deaths remain, to a large extent, obscure. What protests, marches,
        organising happened in these times? Lynn helped source on note of clarification: towards the
        end of 1976 the Apartheid regime fomented violence between migrants (living in migrant worker
        hostels) and their surrounding communities, leading to the horrify violence of December 1976
        and January 1976. An account of that violence can be found
